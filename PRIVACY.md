At Event Notes Pro, available via the Microsoft Store, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that are collected and recorded by Event Notes Pro and how we use it.

## Information We Collect
Event Notes Pro is a reminder application that allows users to create and manage notes tied to specific dates, times, or launch native Windows applications. The only information stored by the application includes:

The content of the notes entered by the user.
The date and time the notes were created.
All data entered into the application is stored locally in a secure virtualized container managed by Windows. This data remains inaccessible to other users on the machine and is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.

## Use of Your Information
The information provided within Event Notes Pro by users is used solely for the intended functionality of the application, such as:

Storing and displaying notes as reminders.
Notifying users of upcoming or scheduled events.
We do not access or share any user data, nor do we collect personal identifiable information. In its current state, the application does not store or track any additional data beyond the content of the notes and their associated timestamps.

## Log Files
Event Notes Pro follows a standard procedure for creating log files, which may include information like internet protocol (IP) addresses, device type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), and date and time stamps. These logs are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable and are only used to ensure the functionality and performance of the application.

## Children's Information
Event Notes Pro does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. The application is not designed for use by children, and no personal information is collected or stored.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any updates by posting the new Privacy Policy here.
